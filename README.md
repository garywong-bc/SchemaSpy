# SchemaSpy

# Introduction


This project contains a Dockerfile and associated files that can be used to setup an automated database documentation tool.

It is compatible with environment variables common OpenShift application deployments.

SchemaSpy itself is an open source project located here:  http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/

# Installation

The application is meant to be installed as an OpenShift application (see below); however, you can also run it locally, if you have the following dependencies installed:

1) Node.js
2) Java (only JRE necessary; no java is compiled)
3) Graphviz

## Required Environment Variables

The environment must have values for each of the variables below defined:

DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME - the hostname of the database server.  

POSTGRESQL_USER - username that will be used to connect to the database

POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD - password that will be used to connect to the database

POSTGRESQL_DATABASE - name of the database to connect to.

CMDLINE_PARMS - optional command-line parameters.


Normally these would be set by the OpenShift template used to deploy the application.

All database activity occurs on application startup, after which static content is served up on a basic HTTP server.

## Run SchemaSpy

Run `npm install` to get the required Node.js dependencies, then `npm start` to run the server.  

# Deploy to OpenShift

The command below will create a BuildConfig, DeploymentConfig, and ancillary resources (service, etc.) in your current OpenShift project.  Apprpriate values should be substitute for each of the environment variables in the command below. 

```
oc new-app https://github.com/bcgov/SchemaSpy.git -e DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=postgresql -e POSTGRESQL_USER=django -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=xyz1234 -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=default
